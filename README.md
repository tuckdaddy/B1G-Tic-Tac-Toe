Tic-Tac-Toe Game

How to play:
     
     run the main method in TicTacToe.kt
     
  
     can change the gameTYPE from PvP to PvC in the board class to see a random move be placed. 
     


Priorities:

         *****Implement multiple screens of the gui. (Main Menu, Settings?, and end game) Theres only one screen as of now.
          -Havent figured out how to have multiple stages of the program yet. 

     T: Square and Display classes have both model and GUI functions, need to encapsulate gui better

   
     T: have different versions of computer iq. right now it just shuffles the potential move and selects the last one in the list 
           K: Bugs
    - when implementing a new message to display the pop up of if you want to play a new game or not, when no is clicked, it still             allows you to play the game.
     - when playing the game the board doesn't reset when deciding to play a game or not.
"Features" 
     T: when computer wins their the gui doesnt display "o-won"
     T: game doesnt automatically restart the game anymore. Somethings wrong when we call the reset method from gui to board class
     T: 





     Later 
     Implement "Big Ten Tic Tac Toe"
     Let players select from any B1G school and their mark will be their team logo. 
     Need to add images to the resources.
     (BIG IF) when a player wins play their teams fight song
